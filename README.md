# HDLBits Solutions

## Introduction

This repository contains all my Verilog solutions to HDLBits 180 problems. HDLBits is a collection of small circuit design exercises for practicing digital hardware design using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL).
Currently, I have completed 137/180 problems, all of which are in order.

## How to Test

To test these solutions, all you must do is change the module name of the exercise to **top_module**, and then run it in HDLBits.
